About the Dataset:
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle: S&P 500 ESG Risk Ratings.

Introduction:
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors have become pivotal considerations for investors assessing the sustainability and ethical practices of companies. This report embarks on an exploratory data analysis of ESG Risk scores within the S&P 500, with a specific focus on the financial sector.

ESG Parameters:
This analysis will center on key ESG parameters, including the Environmental Risk Score, Governance Risk Score, Social Risk Score, and the Total ESG Risk Score. The Total ESG Risk Score is an aggregate measure evaluating a company's overall ESG risk, while the Environmental Risk Score gauges its environmental sustainability and impact. Furthermore, the Governance Risk Score reflects the quality of a company's governance structure.
By looking into these parameters, we aim to gain insights into the ESG performance of companies within the S&P 500, particularly those operating in the financial sector.
